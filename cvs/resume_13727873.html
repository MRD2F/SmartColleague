The second I found out about this position, my I found myself extremely excited. I knew right away this is something I have to be a part of, and something I'd deeply regret if I didn't try. I'm looking to really start my career and be involved with something I can grow into and invest myself in long term. I see that in the Customer Marketing Coordinator position, and couldn't be more excited for this opportunity. 
Before Zendesk, I was at a marketing company supporting the entire staff with demographic research for target market campaigns. I enjoyed the marketing aspect and always thought I'd find myself back in it somehow. Now, I consider myself lucky to be a part of this amazing company, I've put my best effort into everything given to me and I know Zendesk is the only place I want to be. I am responsible for coordinating every interview within the San Francisco office, greeting all candidates onsite, and maintaining an organized status database. As well as my main responsibilities, I've also managed our office expansion and filled in for administrative duties when needed. I had the pleasure of assisting in planning our Holiday Party as well as other team activities. 
What I love most about Recruiting is how much personable interaction there is on a daily basis with different backgrounds and different personalities. I've had the privilege of being trained to always have a poised and appropriate response to every situation, and guidelines for the utmost professionalism with every phone screen, reference call, email, or in-person interview. I recently had the opportunity to visit college campuses to promote Zendesk. I realized then how much I enjoy educating others and making them too, believe in what we do. 
Now that I've found the perfect company, I'm ready for the perfect position that combines everything I love and excel in; planning, coordinating and evangelizing. With my history in Marketing and my current role, I'm used to supporting an entire team and an entire company. I can manage multiple projects at once, I'm highly dependable and extremely detailed. Zendesk has made me a more passionate professional and I would love the opportunity to promote our vision for customer love. Best regards,
