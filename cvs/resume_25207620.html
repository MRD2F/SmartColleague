It is with great pleasure do I take this opportunity to write this recommendation on such an extra ordinary individual who is not only an awesome person to know but a wonderful colleague as well.
During the almost ten (10) years of knowing Bill, he has not only displayed a great talent within the IT organization at Estee Lauder, but has distributed excellent skills and customer service to everyone throughout the company. He is extremely well thought of from every level of management to Senior management. His dedication and diligent to excellence has proven superior time and time again.
When called upon he demonstrates top support in a timely and professional manner not to mention that he completes his tasks thoroughly with accuracy never having to be called back again for the same issue. 
We have been privileged to have such an awesome professional within our organization.
