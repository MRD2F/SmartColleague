With my background in art and psychology, I am confident that I would make a very successful and creative studio assistant. Having worked for the non-profit organization CountyArts, I have been exposed to a number of aspects of the art world. My experience as artist assistant at the Museum of Art demonstrates my capability of working with others through the creative process of production while meeting the challenges presented to me. Also, my education in psychology has allowed me to learn the nuances of people and has provided me with good investigative and analytical skills that will suit your needs for customer assistance. I would appreciate the opportunity to make a substantial contribution by exploring the business of applied art through your design firm. I welcome the opportunity to meet with you to further discuss my candidacy and will call next week to see if we might arrange a time to speak. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I have remarkable skills in digital, and graphic arts, and I would make a great designer in, and out of the field. I've had much experience with graphic, and digital art in High School, and posted my artwork on my website. This skill has taught me many things about creativity. When I make art in any design I notice that I am creating life on a blank piece of paper. To me making art is bringing the creativity to life, and to also give it any kind of emotions to it. I have worked with many people who had more experience then me, and have already started to work under you. If you speak to them they can tell you more about my designs. I am a hard worker, and I will always do my best to get the job done. I hope this has given you the thought of allowing me to work under you.
