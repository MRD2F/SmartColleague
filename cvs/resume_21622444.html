It provided some of the more conventional style kitchen and line cook experience that I had not so much been exposed to at Sushi Time. I also started off at the dishwashing position here. Although I was only there for a short period of time, the exposure to this type of kitchen environment was something that I had been missing in my culinary experience. It also posed a challenge for me since I have been mostly making sushi for the better part of the last few years. The 5 Spot was a highly fast-paced neighborhood kitchen. So, you had to be quick all around and good knife skills are a must. I really enjoyed the challenge of once again having to start all over from the bottom and work my way back up. I ended up leaving The 5 Spot due to constant management changes and an offer to work for my old boss again.</p> </span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_566479964_3_369036507" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" style="

I have been employed by Sushi Time for six years where I started at the very bottom and worked my way to the top. I have worked as a host and as a server which consisted of me greeting customers, helping them to their seats, grabbing their drinks and orders and doing my best to give them the utmost service and keep a smile on their face. I worked as a host/server for about a year, so most of my time has really been spent working in the kitchen and making sushi. In order for me to work my way up through the ranks to sushi, I started at the very bottom in the dish pit. This consisted of me washing all dishes, pots, pans, and silverware. I was also required to prep meats and veggies. Having started at the dish/prep position, these tasks really helped me build a strong work ethic and develop great knife skills as well. I then moved over to cooking which consisted of still participating with prep work, but also cooking and frying all orders. Prep consisted of cutting chicken, beef, shrimp, squid, and all types of veggies. I have been doing sushi now for 3 years. That is, Monday-Saturday 10-10, give or take a few hours. I have had random days off here and there and some holidays, but for the most part 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. I have developed such a passion for food and seeing a smile on a person's face when they bite into the food and love it. I love being in an environment conducive for success and working hard while loving what I do. Being a sushi chef at Sushi Time consists of a wide range of tasks. I've received serve safe managerial training, so I am in charge of making sure everything is clean and up to code. I'm also in charge of going over inventory; ranging from paper/plastics, to all meats and veggies, also drinks and alcohol. This task also means I must handle all ordering trough the different distributors and vendors we may use. My job requires me on a daily basis to: cook and marinate rice, cut and prepare fish for the day, making sushi-rolls, nigiri, sashimi, platters etc. Im also required to assist customers sitting at the sushi bar with any inquiries or concerns they may have. Over the course of the 6 years i have been employed by Towa, I have gained so much. Ive matured so much through this job and sushi really has become such a passion of mine. I am a really hard worker who is also fun to work with, who is merely seeking a new opportunity to further my skill set and continue doing what i love. I have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. And I have no problem adjusting to any style or training. I will work any days/nights or weekends and holidays if necessary.</p> </span> </span> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_EDUC566479965" style="
