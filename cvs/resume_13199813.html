Whether in low market share environments or during construction recessions or a combination of both, I significantly increased market share in any city to which I was assigned. Through my leadership and supervision, I expanded our market share in Miami, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Tulsa, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Orlando, Denver, Tucson, Houston, New Orleans, Biloxi, New York City, Indianapolis, Birmingham, Nashville, Chattanooga, Sacramento, Modesto, and Fresno. </div> <div> Following is a partial list of noteworthy accomplishments from those assignments: </div> <ul> <li> <strong> Miami</strong>  - I developed relationships with building owners in downtown Miami and leveraged those relationships into a group meeting of 17 building owners representing 38 buildings. I delivered a PowerPoint presentation which led to the owners to insist that their building managers give us priority budding status on every project. This one action resulted in substantial growth for my organization.</li> <li> <strong> <em> Minneapolis</em> </strong>  - Redesigned the business development program to focus on building relationships with end-users. As a result, the end-users would insist on using us on their projects. Using this approach, I was able to build enough relationships in the construction industry to experience significant growth, even during a downturn in the construction market. </li> <li> <strong> <em> Austin</em> </strong>  - I took over the business development program of a unit which had steadily declined its market share. After investigating untapped opportunities, I launched an initiative to pursue a new market. The careful execution of my plan resulted in more than a doubling of business in under 12 months. The relationships built with general contractors and end-users led to expanding our market share into San Antonio, Waco, and Dallas. </li> <li> <strong> <em> Denver</em> </strong>  - When I arrived in Denver, out of a list of 200 clients, only 8 were attending monthly informational and sales meetings. I repositioned the agenda away from a "pitchy, preachy" sales presentation to an informational, educational, and interactive format. Within three months, attendance at those meetings grew from 8 to over 90 attendees.</li> </ul> </span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_579772023_2_377429101" style="

Shortly afterwards, I was also named the political director for the three states. During my tenure, I focused primarily on growing market share in Atlanta and Charlotte, leveraging client, political, and end-user relationships to grow market share by 90% in the three states, with growth over 100% in Atlanta alone. Following is a partial list of highlights from those assignments: I attended and addressed shareholder meetings of public companies in Atlanta and built personal relationships with CEO's and Directors from Suntrust Banks, Coca-Cola, Georgia Pacific, Genuine Parts (NAPA), Cousins Properties, Rollins (Orkin Pest Control), Equifax, Synovus Banks, and Georgia Power. Leveraged those relationships to secure work at projects for these companies and gained introductions to the executives of other end-users to provide even more bid opportunities. As Political Director, I endorsed and led labor and community groups to support the election of Shirley Franklin for Mayor of Atlanta, making Franklin the first female Mayor of Atlanta and the first African-American female mayor of any major city in the South. I also endorsed and served as labor liaison to Judge Denise Majette and used my contacts and influence to help her unseat Atlanta political powerhouse and multi-term United States Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.  Additionally, I endorsed and assisted the successful campaigns of the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia State Senate and the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.</span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_579772023_3_377429102" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" style="
