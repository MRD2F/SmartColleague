Certification (K-5), makes me a worthy contender for a teacher position at your school .Utilizing my skills and expertise, I am eager to become a key member of your team.
As specified in the enclosed resume, I offer you the following attributes in order to contribute to your ongoing success:
* Well versed in assisting children in build social, cognitive, emotional, and physical skills. * Adept at providing a stimulating conducive classroom environment. * Special talent for utilizing the highest quality teaching resources and classroom materials.
It is paramount that in order to become the best teacher, good interaction with the students is essential - aside from imparting good knowledge. The expectation of what the students think and how they would think in a particular state of affairs is equally important in my point of view.
In addition, I apply an innovative teaching approach which includes the incorporation of 21st century skill sets that will prepare my students to compete with other students both nationally and internationally. 
Of all my strengths, I take extreme pride in the patience and dedication required to meet the needs of children from socially and culturally diverse backgrounds. My insight not only comes from my years in the classroom as a teacher, but also from my years a pupil. Having lived abroad for many of my formative years, as well as some after college, I understand the delicate balance that is needed to make learning inclusive to all.
