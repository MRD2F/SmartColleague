Lakeland College Kirtland, OH, United States Although it is not a degree for the culinary field, I have been able to apply this degree to my career and it has helped me along in my career obtain various management positions within the culinary field, which I have excelled in in my nine plus years of this profession. My goal is to one day become an executive chef and I feel at this point I will reach it one day soon. Cooking has become a strong passion of mine to where cooking jobs do not feel like jobs anymore, its more like a fun way to live my life day to day able to wake up excited to go learn new cooking skills and make people excited about visiting our restaurant, well which ever one I am working in at the time. High School Diploma: Culinary Arts (Vocational School at Beechwood High School) 2005 Charles F Brush          Lyndhurst, OH, United States While attending Brush High School (My high School) I also attended Beechwood High School from my Junior year (11th Grade) to my senior Year (12th Grade) to study culinary arts where we learned the basics of cooking. I was interested in how to become a cook and how to make various dishes so I would e able to cook meals for my family at home. During high school, although I was in the Culinary Arts program, at the time it did not keep my interest, so when I graduated I got into the Business management field, while attending college I began working as a dishwasher at Houlihans and was intrigued again by working in the kitchen, so much that I was able to be promoted to prep cook and from there I started my Culinary Career. Each year they have it here in Cleveland, and if I am Available, I work at our annual Air show as a cook vendor if there is an opportunity for me. I also like to volunteer to cook for the homeless at our Cleveland Food Bank, during the holidays which I have not been able to do recently, but I do love being able to put smiles on everyone during the holidays with exceptional and delightful meals. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_SKLL700583826" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="heading"> <div class="sectiontitle" id="SECTNAME_SKLL700583826"> Skills</div> </div> <div class="paragraph firstparagraph" id="PARAGRAPH_700583826_1_454250075" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="field singlecolumn" id="700583826FRFM1"> <ul> <li> Kitchen Management</li> <li> Knife SKills</li> <li> Mother Sauce Knowledgeable</li> <li> Ability to Adapt to any situation</li> <li> Leadership skills</li> <li> Employee Development </li> <li> Fast Pace and efficient </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>
