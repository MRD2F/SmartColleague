operated and private facilities licensed or 	contracted with the Department of Mental Health Developed the Advocacy Conditional Release Monitoring Program with 	immediate success by locating and reporting consumers that are non-compliant 	with medication, court orders and state rules Carefully analyzing historical comments, ratings and input from consumers using 	the grievance process allowed us to highlight negative trends prior to becoming 	major problems, as a result the number of consumer grievances dropped almost 	50% since being appointed Advocate General Monitoring and reviewing critical incident reports from facilities resulted in a 	collaboration that prompted facility representatives to engage consumers and 	families to offer assistance, an explanation or other appropriate support that 	soothed initial anger and potentially prevented lawsuits.</li> <li> This was a huge factor in 	the 34% decrease in critical incidents being reported from 8/2014 to 8/2015 Collaborating with the Oklahoma Forensic Review Board regarding 	consumers found not guilty by reason of insanity while providing input and 	advice on current behaviors and trends strengthened relationships between the 	governor appointed board and the department By participating in treatment team meetings of consumers found not guilty by 	reason of insanity and those never to attain competency, focusing on risk 	assessments, progression through the program and potential placement for the 	consumers, we were able to streamline the phases of the program making it more 	productive and efficient Staying aware of the state budget status, I was able to make appropriate 	adjustments while managing this division's budget.</li> <li> As a result this division 	finished the fiscal year 20% under budget allowing the savings to be passed on to 	divisions where services were being cut.</li> </ul> </span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_653531922_2_425293750" itemscope=""
