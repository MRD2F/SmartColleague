into emergency shelter, providing weekly domestic violence education classes
and groups, accompany and advocate for clients at the Juvenile Dependency and
or superior court, as well as linking victims up with

Assessment Meetings). These are meetings where the social workers and I provide
the information collected from the family and present them to CFS social
workers, supervisors and management regarding which key factors are present, which
are not, assessing the degree of risk in a family and if the family has a plan,
support system and the likelihood of future maltreatment to a child or
adolescent. I will also attend TDM's (Team Decision Making meetings) a Team

cases are closed. I also present yearly workshops and
training for CFS staff, new hires and interns regarding domestic violence. I
also continuously develop and provide brochures, written material and the
latest information to raise the awareness of domestic violence. Part of my
