My name is James Sauders and I have worked in retail sales in some form since I was 14 years old and the last six and a half of those years have been spent working for AT&amp;T in retail. I'm a hard working, loyal and energetic manager and top-rated sales associate with more than 8 years of leading dynamic sales teams in fast-paced markets. I'm always early and if doing the job correctly means traveling to meet individual customers based on their time constraints, then working late is what I'll do. I don't quit until the job is done and I know customer service will be my number one priority along with hitting my goals. I know that I would be an excellent fit for this position and a reliable source of success for your team.
