Include information on how you will follow-up. Complimentary Close Sincerely, Signature The following application letter template lists the information you need to include in the letter you submit with your resume when applying for a job. Use the application template as a guideline to create customized letters to send to employers with your resume. Then review letter samples to get ideas on writing your own application letters. The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, include it. Middle Paragraphs: The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume, don't just repeat it. Try to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text. Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position. Include information on how you will follow-up. State that you will do so and indicate when (one week's time is typical). You may want to reduce the time between sending out your resume and follow up if you fax or email it.
