I try to be certain the customer's needs are met to the highest standards. Professional attitude and open mind to learning new concepts and ideas as well as new products. Control wiring and protection circuitry, Customer service skills. Served as an interface between engineering and production departments.  Other basic skills: wiring, drilling and tapping, soldering, layout and installation of new equipment, wiring of motor controls. I am able to think on my feet, under pressure and deadlines, while keeping multiple projects going. The ability to follow thru and work under pressure has given me the ability to meet emergent needs. Handling critical situations has always been my specialty. The ability to learn and absorb new information has been continually proven through past work experience and current education. Proven leader. Keeping up with current standards and methods thru on going school and keeping up with industry thru current publications. Just finished Geometry and Trigonometry as well as collage English. I am currently enrolled and nearly finished with Process measurement, Industrial controls along with Industrial robotics and Electronic devices (amplifier circuitry). I am willing to relocate as needed. The Veteran's Administration is backing both my education and return to the workforce. I can and will be a great asset to any company you may place me with. Long term goals, teach and manage others and to find my place within industry.</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>
