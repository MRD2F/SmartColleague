I was so insecure about everything, until one day I decided to put all the insecurity thoughts aside and show my true strength and confidence. My sale skills went from zero to none to one hundred. My best day is when I sold 31 phones in one day with accessories, I was so proud about how hard I work to get to my goal. I have a lot of thanks to my coworkers because they showed me how to push myself to my highest limit and conquer my goals. They also showed me how to be a team player and to always help everyone and not just customers. One of the best months was when I sold 145 phones and over $3,088 worth in accessories. Routinely helped as many as ten customers each day in a high-volume retail outlet.I also fulfilled all supervisory duties when the store manager was on vacation. I'm very proud on what I've learn over the couple of months working at Boost Mobile of Mobile Factory, I thank them for helping me develop my skills and making me into the person I know I am.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_EDUC718443105" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="heading"> <div class="sectiontitle" id="SECTNAME_EDUC718443105"> Education</div> </div> <div class="paragraph firstparagraph" id="PARAGRAPH_718443105_1_465304842" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/EducationalOrganization" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="singlecolumn"> <span class="paddedline" itemprop="description"> <span class="degree" dependency="DGRE" id="718443105DGRE1" itemprop="name"> High School Diploma</span> <span class="programline" dependency="STUY" id="718443105STUY1"> </span> <span class="datesWrapper"> <span class="jobdates" id="718443105GRYR1"> 2014</span> </span> </span> <span class="paddedline"> <span class="companyname companyname_educ" id="718443105SCHO1" itemprop="name"> Northwood High School</span> <span> , </span> <span class="joblocation jobcity" id="718443105SCIT1"> City</span> <span> , </span> <span class="joblocation jobstate" id="718443105SSTA1"> State</span> <span> , </span> <span class="joblocation jobstate" id="718443105SCNT1"> Unitedstates</span> </span> <span class="paddedline"> <span class="field" id="718443105FRFM1"> <p align="LEFT"> During my four years of high school I struggle a lot to manage my grades and make sure that I would be on the right path to achieve my goals but some how I would always let something get in the way of my goal.
