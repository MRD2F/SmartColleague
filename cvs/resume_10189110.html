representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.</li> <li> In this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.</li> <li> I worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these parts as necessary.</li> <li> When services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate paperwork to purchasing.</li> <li> Daily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.</li> <li> Being a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more closely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.</li> <li> Like coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.</li> <li> In addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed accurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.</li> <li> Being on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where buyers spend more time on parts themselves.</li> <li> Purchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.</li> <li> I have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.</li> <li> If it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.</li> <li> Buyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.</li> <li> We then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.</li> <li> Outside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.</li> <li> In addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an industry standard to rise above the competition.</li> <li> Purchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.</li> <li> These savings of course benefits everyone on the company.</li> <li> Purchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is key in this position.</li> </ul> </span>
