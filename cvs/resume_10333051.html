    "> <div class="field singlecolumn" id="568958111FRFM1"> I am a self-motivated and patient focused nurse executive with a strong history of progressive leadership. I have worked in health care for the past 12 years and in nursing for the past 9. I have been honored to quickly and progressively build upon my experiences to assume key leadership positions. These opportunities have allowed me to lead the charge on increased facility efficiency and cost savings, while ensuring stellar quality programming with a focus on infection control, risk management, and quality improvement. Under my direction, organizational improvements in those areas have flourished while experiencing record surgical volume and implementation of new and innovative procedures. Change under pressure has been staple in my professional life, and an aspect that has quickly molded me in to a quick-witted yet careful professional; always putting the patient first, but never losing sight of strategic goals to ensure organizational success.</div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_HILT568958112" style="
