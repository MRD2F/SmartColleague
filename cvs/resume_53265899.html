My early influences were all centered on food. My grandparents grew and sold their own vegetables and meats.  <i> Dennis Turkey Farm </i> was known for its customer satisfaction and ‘clean farm' practices. I learned about environmental stewardship from grandparents that farmed holistically. I fondly remember working with Grandpa Dennis, plucking turkey feathers and processing chickens to fill the latest orders.Inside the farmhouse, I sat wide eyed watching my grandmother make what seemed like magic in her big wooden bowl filling the orders for our family restaurant called <i> Glisans</i> .I credit my grandmother for instilling within me the passion for savory and baking and using all of the chef senses! I have worked practically all of my life in some form within the hospitality world. I am very creative, positive, warm, personable with strong attention to detail and management skills. I pride myselfon quality of work with a strong work ethic. I pride myself on high customer satisfaction and client retention. I am a true leader and a fantastic administrator and teacher. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_ADDI670878021" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="heading"> <div class="sectiontitle" id="SECTNAME_ADDI670878021"> Additional Information</div> </div> <div class="paragraph firstparagraph" id="PARAGRAPH_670878021_1_436178080" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="field singlecolumn" id="670878021FRFM1"> <p align="LEFT"> 1998-2000-Carter and Carter P.C.-Owned and operated a small catering establishment with my ex-husband.
