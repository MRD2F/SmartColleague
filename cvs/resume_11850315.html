Successful public relation professionals need to be creative, dynamic, organized, team-oriented with a strong desire to succeed and these are qualities I have been recognized for in all of my previous roles. I have worked for iconic fashion brands such as ANN
Inc. and The Children's Place where I managed national and international media relations, special events and served as the on camera company spokesperson.
I have a consistent record of creating, implementing and leading extremely successful public relations campaigns and executing high profile events. As you will note, I have solid interpersonal skills, with the ability to interface with individuals at all levels. I also have strong talents in creating, writing, and producing communication pieces. My organizational skills have allowed me to prioritize schedules and complete projects within time and budget guidelines.</div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_HILT723331199" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="heading"> <div class="sectiontitle thinbottomborder" id="SECTNAME_HILT723331199"> Highlights</div> </div> <div class="paragraph firstparagraph" id="PARAGRAPH_723331199_1_468481242" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="singlecolumn maincolumn"> <table class="twocol"> <tbody> <tr> <td class="field twocol_1 charspace" id="723331199SKC11"> MS Office Suite: Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Project Pro;
