I began in commercial design, space planning,   specifying, and decorating offices, including reception areas,   conference rooms, large and small cubicle spaces using Steelcase, Stow   Davis and Westinghouse ASD (aka Knoll).<br/> <br/> I have designed medical/dental   offices and hospital areas, retail spaces, showrooms, trade show   exhibits, salons, restaurants, night clubs, apartment floor plans and   complex site plans, etc.
In the residential field, I have   designed and supervised construction of a number of entire homes and   major remodeling projects, including all specifications and the final   decorating. I have specialized in all phases of window treatments, from   measuring to installation. I have specialized in kitchen/bath and   storage design.   I am familiar with building codes and have been skillful at   trade-specific CAD programs.<br/> <br/> I have also done site planning and landscape design.  At one point I was involved in site planning and development of an entire   subdivision.</div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_EXPR508046111" style="
