I Was in our unarmed drill team, I was second in command. I would be
   in drill meets and in competitions. Not only was this distraction for me but it was also a learning experience for me. I gathered leader ship skills, team work skills, also responsibility skills. When we needed to get something done I
   was taught to take the initiative to get things done. I did lead a couple of our drill meets. I did learn how to handle
   hard situations.</div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_EXPR703824661" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="heading bottomborder"> <div class="sectiontitle" id="SECTNAME_EXPR703824661"> Work Experience</div> </div> <div class="paragraph firstparagraph" id="PARAGRAPH_703824661_1_456174712" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="singlecolumn"> <span class="paddedline"> <span class="jobtitle" id="703824661JTIT1"> Customer Advocate</span> <span> </span> <span class="datesWrapper"> <span class="jobdates" format="%b %Y" id="703824661JSTD1"> Dec 2014</span> <span>  to </span> <span class="jobdates" format="%b %Y" id="703824661EDDT1"> Nov 2015</span> <br/> </span> </span> <span class="paddedline" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/postalAddress"> <span class="companyname" id="703824661COMP1" itemprop="name"> Company Name</span> <span>  -
