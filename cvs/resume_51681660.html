I love working with a team and collaborating, though I can work alone and am happy to do what is asked. I am not concerned with receiving a position of power, I listen to instructions very intently. However if the situation called for it I can easily give instruction in a polite and respectful manner. I am also very skilled with almost all power tools, safety laws, and am a skilled teacher if the occasion calls for it. Though I enjoy the work in art department I am capable of filling any position if need be.
