Common in every role at every company is finding success through a laser-like focus on the business needs of customers. With over a decade of online media experience, I remain fascinated by the intersection of media creation, distribution, consumption, and monetization. The revolution is still in the early stages, and increasing consumer control over what they watch and listen to will have broad-ranging impact over who makes money in this ecosystem, and how. Planning and building the enabling technologies is what I love. </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_HILT740673228" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="heading bottomborder"> <div
