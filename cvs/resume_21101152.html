With this comes a proven track record and an excellent reputation .After my time at the Highlawn, I was given the reigns of their sister restaurant The Manor as the Chef D' Cuisine because of my work ethic, dedication to my staff and my craft. With the opportunity to run my own establishment, I was brought on to open gastro pubs such as Sixty Park next door to the PAC Center and the Tap House Grill. I opened these establishments as upscale casual and rustic comfort food with banquet and catering on site to excellent reviews and a steady following. I am also heavily involved as a lead chef consultant for creating successful menus and kitchen designs to open such restaurants as Halcyon and Montclair Station in Montclair NJ and Bistro Seven Three in Bernardsville. I stand by my food with simple and colorful plate designs with bold flavors and my ability to train and inspire my staff with my progressive and lead by example philosophy. With me you will get a loyal hardworking chef with a love of our industry. I take my craft seriously bringing no ego just passion, pride and ambition number. I am available to interview at your earliest convenience if you believe I meet your standards.</div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_HILT504784922" style="
