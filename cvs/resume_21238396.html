department, monitor nursery, and monitor pool. 
In July, I work the DSL Swim Championships where I am required to
support facility needs for each team; direct spectators to appropriate areas,
maintain a clean, safe event site, and answer general questions.  Working with people one-on-one and the

different questions and problems regularly.

frequently asked; make smoothies, work snack bar, conduct sales in sports
