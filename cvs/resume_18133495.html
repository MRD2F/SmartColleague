This position required coordinating with IS Leadership at our corporate parent, Community Health Systems, and balancing the same with local Administration. Early in my tenure, we were able to develop a new level of communication and cooperation between Nursing, Financial, Administration, Physicians, IS and CHS Corporate. I sat on a number of committees both within the company and the community to maintain the cooperation that allowed us to advance. In addition to successfully developing and mentoring an exceptional IS team of 6 during my two years in this position, we implemented the first three phases of Electronic Medical Record through the hospital and owned physician offices, completed a new data center implementation, conversion to fiber backbone communications and digital phone system, Windows 7 upgrade for over 800 users and total systems upgrades in the clinical departments. This facility was shifted to a higher level within the CHS network of 250 hospitals and awarded numerous national accolades from third-parties due to some of the changes made by my department and team. I was brought into South Baldwin Regional Medical Center as the facility's first IS-based PACS Administrator.  After initial reorganization of the PACS environment and creation of PACS related support procedures and documentation, my responsibilities quickly expanded to IS projects where I identified productivity improvements that could be made.  Some of these projects included: Becoming the 24/7 dedicated technical resource for all Radiology functions, meaningful use implementation coordination, fileserver redesign for more stable and productive use, network and system optimizations where needed to improve efficiency, outlying clinic improvements to encourage "single-company" relations, and a number of others where needed.  My primary focus has always been providing the necessary tools and support for the constant improvement of patient care.</span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_492907677_2_321486213" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="singlecolumn"> <span class="paddedline" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/postalAddress"> <span class="jobtitle" id="492907677JTIT2"> Manager, ImageLink PACS</span> <br/> <span class="joblocation jobcity" id="492907677JCIT2" itemprop="addressLocality"> City</span> <span> , </span> <span class="joblocation jobstate" id="492907677JSTA2" itemprop="addressRegion"> State</span> </span> <span class="paddedline"> <span class="companyname" id="492907677COMP2" itemprop="name"> Company Name</span> <span> /</span> <span class="datesWrapper"> <span class="jobdates" format="%b %Y" id="492907677JSTD2"> Jun 2006</span> <span>  to </span> <span class="jobdates" format="%b %Y" id="492907677EDDT2"> Jul 2011</span> </span> </span> <span class="paddedline"> <span class="jobline" id="492907677JDES2" itemprop="description"> My hiring position at CPSI was as a Senior Project Manager in the ITS Special Projects division.  After only 3 months in this position, I was recruited into the ImageLink PACS division as an Implementation Project Manager.  Before being promoted to Assistant Manager then Manager of this division, my primary responsibilities were system install scheduling, preparation and complete onsite implementation.  The three week onsite implementation of the ImageLink system entailed; coordinating server placement and networking with hospital IT, directing the installation of all server and reading hardware, coordination with all modality vendors to establish DICOM communication with the new system, integration with CPSI and other vendor HIS, Radiologist and staff training  and conversion of data from the previous Radiology system.  A number of these sites requested that we perform the conversion of data without involving the previous vendor.  Success in these situations required developing an in-depth familiarity with numerous systems, including: McKesson, GE Centricity, Philips iSite, OrthoView, E-Film and Spectra PACS systems. Because responsibilities included development planning with Programming and travel with Sales to assist in promoting the ImageLink product, I acquired additional familiarity with these competitor systems in order to keep ImageLink current with the needs of our customers and provide my employees with training relevant to their implementations.  This broad spectrum of involvement with multiple PACS systems left me knowledgeable on their use, tools and configuration.
CPSI of Mobile
In September 2006, ImageLink was in use at 27 of CPSI's 950 hospitals nationwide.  Of the 101 sites added during my time in ImageLink, I implemented 58, either directly or in an onsite supervisory capacity while retaining ultimate responsibility for all installs and the overall performance of the division and its employees.</span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_492907677_3_321486214" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="singlecolumn"> <span class="paddedline" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/postalAddress"> <span class="jobtitle" id="492907677JTIT3"> IT Services/Public Relations Project Manager</span> <br/> <span class="joblocation jobcity" id="492907677JCIT3" itemprop="addressLocality"> City</span> <span> , </span> <span class="joblocation jobstate" id="492907677JSTA3" itemprop="addressRegion"> State</span> </span> <span class="paddedline"> <span class="companyname" id="492907677COMP3" itemprop="name"> Company Name</span> <span> /</span> <span class="datesWrapper"> <span class="jobdates" format="%b %Y" id="492907677JSTD3"> Oct 2003</span> <span>  to </span> <span class="jobdates" format="%b %Y" id="492907677EDDT3"> Apr 2006</span> </span> </span> <span class="paddedline"> <span class="jobline" id="492907677JDES3" itemprop="description"> In addition to managing all aspects of the company's information systems, I handled the development and execution of public education and outreach plans and materials, including public meeting organization and facilitation, direct mail, printed collateral, website updates and public relations events.
