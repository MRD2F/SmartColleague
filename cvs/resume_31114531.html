Programming Arts at DSU, I have drastically improved the bottom line of
shows at the Cox Performing Arts Center and the Tanner Amphitheater and have simultaneously created and funded
permanent improvements and endowments. The Trailblazer Summer Concert Series at
the Tanner went from consistently losing money to net profit in both 2015 and
2016.

By changing the way tickets are
marketed, I was able to generate a 30% increase in season ticket memberships to the Celebrity Concert Series in only one year. I have also created a scholarship
program for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported
twelve students in 2016. I sought and obtained donations from the community in
order to completely renovate the Cox Center's Green room and made permanent
improvements to the aesthetics of the stage at Tanner Amphitheater including
adding shade to the performing area as well as new lighting and sound
equipment. All of this was completed without receiving any additional funding from the University.</div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_EXPR847018193" style="

at Dixie State University, I am responsible for the cultural arts activities at
multiple venues. The Cox Performing Arts Center (1200 seats) is the home of the Celebrity
Concert Series (CCS) which has been the premier performing arts series in
the area since 1958. I am responsible for the management of the CCS and
my duties include overseeing all programming, marketing, hospitality, financial accounts, administration, and
fulfillment. I am also responsible for interacting with and guiding the
CCS Board of Directors comprised of community leaders and performing arts
enthusiasts. The CCS plays host to a wide variety of entertainment genres.
Our current season includes Manhattan Transfer with Take 6, the Utah Symphony,
The Drifters, GENTRI, and Canadian Brass to name a few.

I am also responsible, during the
summer months, for all facets of programming and management of the Tanner
Amphitheater (1600 seats) in Springdale, Utah at the entrance to Zion National Park. Before
I came to DSU, this outdoor theater was used for a handful of local artists
playing weekend shows on a bare stage. I have completely rethought this venue
by adding visual design elements, incorporating concessions and catering,
seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol, and structuring the programming
around two series formats. The first series is comprised of festival-style events where each
performance date is focused on a specific genre of music and marketed as a
standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show. The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an important,
well-attended festival that was supported both by the community and the
tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion National
Park. 

The second series is an original
show called, "Sanctuary: The Story of Zion" which was written to
correspond with the centennial celebration of our National Parks. I co-created,
produced, and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance
and tech team. This show was based on feedback we received from the area
business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be supported by
the tourists who come to the area. Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National
Park though storytelling, music, and the unique usage of video projection to
share testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world-class
artists and climbers who call Zion home.</span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_847018193_2_552759377" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" style="

creating production music that has been featured on such networks as Discovery,

a talented staff of creative minded engineers and musicians. 

Spiral Studios has also been
involved with many festival-style shows by hiring and managing artists and providing A/V equipment.  In my time at Spiral Studios, I was able
to create many industry relationships with both entertainers and
management.  These relationships have
allowed for a deep understanding of performing arts from the perspective of an
entertainer as well as a director.  This
knowledge informs my decisions and gives me a unique perspective in my role as Director of
Programming.  I continue to own Spiral Studios but have turned day-to-day operations over to a studio manager and a staff of creative engineers.</span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_847018193_4_552764873" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" style="
