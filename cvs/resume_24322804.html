I have completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Technology with a concentration in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science from Middle Tennessee State University. I feel that I am a great candidate to be employed in technical role due my education and experience with ArcelorMittal and PepsiCo. Course work for my degree included instrumentation controls and engineering economy, which is beneficial for technical manufacturing positions overseeing capital spend. Instrumentation controls class work show the design of electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems and other associated equipment that work in relation to one another. Engineering Economy provided me with the concepts of OEE, supply chain, and project cost effectiveness. I was able to use my education and gain experience with ArcelorMittal as an Operations Technician. As an Operations Technician, I was responsible for the OEE of automated weld cells. To ensure productivity, I reviewed faults in PLC programming, Fanuc Robot programming, or mechanically which required my problem solving abilities. I was required to understand CAD drawings and wiring schematics to troubleshoot and install components on the line, in which one has to have great analytical skills to accomplish. In my most recent experience with Frito Lay, I have gained experience through the Project Engineer &amp; Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader positions. The Project Engineer role required me to have excellent verbal and written communication skills. While holding this position I worked extensively with all departments within the facility on their requests to improve safety, quality &amp; efficiencies. I was the technical point of contact between Frito Lay department leaders &amp; vendors/ integrators. This role required my organization and planning skills to be at the highest level for projects to be implemented with minimum distribution to the supply chain. I currently hold the position of Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader.  This role includes maintaining &amp; improving line OEE and doing so within the limitation of a parts, labor and capital budget. My team and I review daily reports by production supervisors to solve issues ranging from an immediate daily fix or prepping the work for the next preventive maintenance schedule.  I am responsible for developing the skills of 34 mechanics, two admins and three shift supervisors by providing feedback on a one to one basis. Also, I am responsible for training mechanics to ensure work was being performed safely by OSHA standards and ensure a quality product was being produced to Frito and Federal/State Regulatory Laws. Frito Lay developed my leadership skills requiring me to engage and develop personnel to meet KPIs. My college career at MTSU, along with my vocation at ArcelorMittal and Frito Lay has provided me with great experience. My experience would make me a great candidate for this position at your facility. Thank you for taking the time to look at my resume and considering my request. Sincerely, Aaron Lovely Engineering Maintenance manager, who is a self-motivated, passionate individual with excellent decision-making skills, is seeking a technical position within an engineering team. Courses for an Engineering Technology degree require the ability to learn electrical and mechanical systems. Successfully put my education to use and expanded my learning in the electrical and mechanical field with my profession at ArcelorMittal and PepsiCo Frito Lay Division. Strengths include communication, team work, problem solving skills, and leadership. </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_HILT1065198695" style="padding-top:0px;"> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_EXPR1065198692" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="heading bottomborder"> <div class="sectiontitle" id="SECTNAME_EXPR1065198692"> Experience</div> </div> <div class="paragraph firstparagraph" id="PARAGRAPH_1065198692_1_713312409" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="singlecolumn"> <span class="paddedline"> <span class="jobtitle" id="1065198692JTIT1"> Engineering Business Unit Leader</span> <span> </span> <span class="datesWrapper"> <span class="jobdates" format="%b %Y" id="1065198692JSTD1"> Jan 2015</span> <span>  to </span> <span class="jobdates" format="%b %Y" id="1065198692EDDT1"> Current</span> <br/> </span> </span> <span class="paddedline" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/postalAddress"> <span class="companyname" id="1065198692COMP1" itemprop="name"> Company Name</span> <span>  － </span> <span class="joblocation jobcity" id="1065198692JCIT1" itemprop="addressLocality"> City</span> <span> , </span> <span class="joblocation jobstate" id="1065198692JSTA1" itemprop="addressRegion"> State</span> </span> <span class="jobline" id="1065198692JDES1" itemprop="description"> <ul> <li> Increased OEE performance from 13th rank to 4th in company by developing crewing models and using best practices with computer management maintenance system.</li> <li> Managed yearly labor budget of $3.1Million and parts budget of $2.4Million successfully achieved a goal of $1 better to plan.</li> <li> Executed $1.2Million of productivity projects through automation, efficiency improvements &amp;
