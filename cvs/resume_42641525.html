When not documenting ERAM anomalies, or consulting on ERAM work-a-rounds, I conducted training of the controllers at the sectors working traffic, concerning ERAM functionality.

As a team member I collected data and collaborated on the final report concerning the operational readiness for ERAM's National Deployment.                                                       </li> <li> 28 years of experience working transition sectors from domestic Air Traffic Services to Oceanic Air Traffic services. This airspace required manual coordination on route, altitude and time estimates with Oakland Oceanic sectors; as well as establishing oceanic separation standers for the affected flight before entering an oceanic sector. This Radar-Non Radar environment required me to correlate flight plans with incoming and outgoing tracks, and either terminate or re-identify the flight in a Radar environment.</li> <li> Worked Arrival and Departure traffic In and out of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) for 32 years. This required closely working with a level 5 Approach control, facilitating the separation of aircraft during the transition phase of a flight from the terminal to the En Route environment. This requires a strong working knowledge of geography for expediting flight on their flight plans, while working within flow control restriction, weather, and volume limitations. And before the wide acceptance of GPS navigation this required long range vectoring, which required consideration of weather and traffic situations. Sequenced traffic for Seattle Approach (S46) from high sectors (above FL230) and low sectors (below FL240) as well as converging routes, in sectors that were over the Cascade Mountains, which introduced weather, and train factors.</li> <li> With 28 years of experience working aircraft in a transitional phase of flight (back and forth from terminal and En Route) I have extensive knowledge and experience with different types of route structures including the new Advanced R-NAV SID's and STAR's with their descend and climb via phases of transitioning to and from the En Route to Terminal environment. As well as more conventional types of En Route navigation like Jet routs, victor airway, "Q" routs, "K" fixes, as well as point-to point GPS/RNAV/ Latitude/longitude Navigation, and conventional SID's and STAR's.</li> <li> I worked daily military training flights on IR and VR routes, airspace reservation both moving ALTRAV and special Use airspace (SUA). I have experience with Naval (P3, F18, E2, A6 and EA6 aircraft, Air force (F16, F15, F4, C17, C141, KC35, B2 and B52), Army (A10, UH60, and AH64), and Air National Guard (F4, F15 and F16) and their missions. The sectors I was certified on had Naval, Air force, and Army bases and a joint civilian/Air National Guard base. My experience involves clearing fighters into and recovering fighters from special use airspace, as well as air refueling missions and helicopters for the Army back and forth from base to training grounds.</li> <li> Controlled cross border flights between the USA and Canada for over 32 years. Experience includes passing manual time estimates, flight plans, and making and taking manual hand offs via voice calls. Also experience at some of the limitations of CATTS (the Canadian version of ERAM) and ERAM's interfaces are.</li> <li> Have 32 years experience providing approach control services at uncontrolled, and tower controlled airports. One of the tower-controlled airports was Paine Field in Everett, WA. Pain field (PAE) is a key airport in the Boeing Company manufacturing process, and worked closely with Boeing in their testing and certification process for new airplanes. Also Pain field is an airport that many new pilots would go and do multiple practice approaches for training. This environment meant the traffic pattern at Paine field had a large variety of aircraft, Large commercial aircraft, navy fighters and small single engine trainers, this required the  separation and sequence the traffic but apply wake turbulence procedures in many instances. While providing approach control services at PAE, we meet the requirements to use 3NM separation in most of the area. This required vigilantes as to how fare the aircraft was from the RADAR antenna, and adding to the complexity of this particular airspace, was the West side was over water, or low lying land; but the train rose very quickly to the East, required different techniques for lost com or vectoring to the final approach course.</li> <li> Preformed duties as a SME in Plans and Programs (ZSE-510) consulting on the feasibly of releasing equipment to Airways and Facilities for maintained.</li> <li> Preformed SME duties in Airspace (ZSE-520) working on letters of agreements with adjacent facilities, as well as airspace changes. During My involvement as an Airspace SME, I was part of a team that was involved in some major sector realignments that facilitated arrivals and departures from the South and East at SEA; as well as traffic transiting between Seattle (SEA) and Portland OR (PDX). During this realignment we also collaborated on procedures and sector alignment for Vancouver Canada (YVR) Arrivals and Departures from the South. Also I was also involved in the initial stages of National High Altitude Redesign.</li> <li> April 1991 I was certified as a Controller in Charge (CIC). As CIC I was responsible for the same tasks that a First Line supervisor would for dally operations. Assigning work, opening and closing sectors, handling Emergences, and approving leave and shift changes with in prescribed guild lines.</li> <li> December 1987 I was certified as an On The Job Instructor (OJTI).</li> <li> November 1986 I Certified as a Certified Professional Controller (CPC) in Area C of Seattle ARTCC. Then in September 1988 I voluntary transferred to Area A at Seattle ARTCC, and became area rated May 1989 until retirement January 2016.</li> </ul> </span> </span> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_EDUC689684267" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="heading"> <div class="sectiontitle" id="SECTNAME_EDUC689684267"> Education</div> </div> <div class="paragraph firstparagraph" id="PARAGRAPH_689684267_1_447739323" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/EducationalOrganization" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="singlecolumn"> <span class="paddedline" itemprop="description"> <span class="degree" dependency="DGRE" id="689684267DGRE1" itemprop="name"> </span> <span class="programline" dependency="STUY" id="689684267STUY1"> Safety Risk Management </span> <span> ,</span> <span class="jobdates" id="689684267GRYR1"> 2013</span> </span> <span class="paddedline txtLeft"> <span class="field" id="689684267FRFM1"> </span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_689684267_2_447770950" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/EducationalOrganization" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="singlecolumn"> <span class="paddedline" itemprop="description"> <span class="degree" dependency="DGRE" id="689684267DGRE2" itemprop="name"> </span> <span class="programline" dependency="STUY" id="689684267STUY2"> On-The-Job Techniques for instructors </span> <span> ,</span> <span class="jobdates" id="689684267GRYR2"> 1992</span> </span> <span class="paddedline txtLeft"> <span class="field" id="689684267FRFM2"> </span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_689684267_3_447743338" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/EducationalOrganization" style="padding-top:5px;"> <div class="singlecolumn"> <span class="paddedline" itemprop="description"> <span class="degree" dependency="DGRE" id="689684267DGRE3" itemprop="name"> </span> <span class="programline" dependency="STUY" id="689684267STUY3"> Controller in Charge Training (CIC)</span> <span> ,</span> <span class="jobdates" id="689684267GRYR3"> 1991</span> </span> <span class="paddedline txtLeft"> <span class="field" id="689684267FRFM3"> <p align="LEFT"> Recertified</p> <ul> <li>  June 2015 </li> <li>  June 2014</li> <li>  May 2011</li> <li>  November 2000</li> </ul> <br/> </span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_689684267_4_447745077" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/EducationalOrganization" style="padding-top:5px;"> <div class="singlecolumn"> <span class="paddedline" itemprop="description"> <span class="degree" dependency="DGRE" id="689684267DGRE4" itemprop="name"> </span> <span class="programline" dependency="STUY" id="689684267STUY4"> On-The-Job Instructor Training</span> <span> ,</span> <span class="jobdates" id="689684267GRYR4"> 1987</span> </span> <span class="paddedline txtLeft"> <span class="field" id="689684267FRFM4"> <p align="LEFT"> Recertified</p> <ul> <li>  November 2007</li> <li>  November 2000</li> <li>  January 1992</li> </ul> </span> </span> </div> </div> <div class="paragraph" id="PARAGRAPH_689684267_5_447749195" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/EducationalOrganization" style="padding-top:10px;"> <div class="singlecolumn"> <span class="paddedline" itemprop="description"> <span class="degree" dependency="DGRE" id="689684267DGRE5" itemprop="name"> Associate of Applied Science</span> <span> :</span> <span class="programline" dependency="STUY" id="689684267STUY5"> Manufacturing Engineering </span> <span class="jobdates" id="689684267GRYR5"> </span> </span> <span class="paddedline"> <span class="companyname companyname_educ" id="689684267SCHO5" itemprop="name"> Highline Community Collage</span> <span>  － </span> <span class="joblocation jobcity" id="689684267SCIT5"> City</span> <span> , </span> <span class="joblocation jobstate" id="689684267SSTA5"> State</span> <span> , </span> <span class="joblocation jobstate" id="689684267SCNT5"> USA</span> </span> <span class="paddedline txtLeft"> <span class="field" id="689684267FRFM5"> </span> </span> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_AFIL688552638" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="heading"> <div class="sectiontitle" id="SECTNAME_AFIL688552638"> Affiliations</div> </div> <div class="paragraph firstparagraph" id="PARAGRAPH_688552638_1_447751245" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="field singlecolumn txtLeft" id="688552638FRFM1"> <p align="LEFT"> National Air Traffic Controllers Association</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" id="SECTION_SKLL688552639" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="heading"> <div class="sectiontitle" id="SECTNAME_SKLL688552639"> Skills</div> </div> <div class="paragraph firstparagraph" id="PARAGRAPH_688552639_1_447047923" style="padding-top:0px;"> <div class="field singlecolumn txtLeft" id="688552639FRFM1"> <p align="LEFT"> <b> En Route Air Traffic Controller: </b> from August 1983 -
